- ✅ Added comprehensive test suite

### 5. Documentation
- ✅ Created `BONK_INTEGRATION.md` with complete documentation
- ✅ Created test file `contracts/solana/tests/bonk-integration.js`
- ✅ All tests passing ✅

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Deployment
1. **Deploy updated Solana program**:
   ```bash
   cd contracts/solana
   anchor build
   anchor deploy
   ```

2. **Add Bonk as supported asset**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/add-bonk-asset.js
   ```

3. **Update environment variables**:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_BONK_MINT=DezXAZ8z7PnrnRJjz3wXBoRgixCa6xjnB7YaB1pPB263
   ```

### For Production
1. **Replace placeholder price feed** with actual Chainlink oracle
2. **Add comprehensive monitoring** for Bonk positions
3. **Implement liquidation alerts** for Bonk positions
4. **Add analytics dashboard** for Bonk metrics

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Risk Management
- Lower LTV for volatile meme tokens
- Higher liquidation threshold for safety
- Minimum deposit to prevent dust attacks
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Price Oracle
- Chainlink integration for accurate pricing
- Fallback to CoinGecko API
- Stale price detection and handling

## 📈 Expected Impact

### User Benefits
